# AUD-jpg2word
A tool to merge all your pictures into a single .docx file

## Usage
You can either run the program using the main.py file or via the .exe file which can be found in the [most recent release](https://github.com/SchoolRepos/AUD-jpg2word/releases/tag/topsl-fix-fehla) of this repository.
Running the program will put all the pictures in the current directory into the output.docx file but you can also specify a different location by putting the path as an additional argument.
